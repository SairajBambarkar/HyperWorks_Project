# HyperWorks_Project
Eleation Intership Project (2021)

This project aimed to analyze and compare the mechanical and thermal properties of four engineering materials—AL 7475, Nickel Aluminium Bronze Alloy, Graphite Cast Iron, and Sand Cast Magnesium Alloy—to determine their suitability for specific industrial applications. Requirements included identifying material density, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity, followed by comparative evaluation for performance optimization. The study resulted in a comprehensive property database and selection insights; key learnings involved understanding material property trade-offs and their engineering implications, while technical skills used included materials testing, data analysis, and engineering property evaluation.
